# Jaxxon Jargon's Soldiers Vs. Zombies
 
Experience a new Zombie Apocalypse. Using a variety of weapons, eliminate all the zombies to win. Beware! This game is simple, but harder than it looks.

Here is the point system: one point for every zombie killed, one point for every window shattered, and minus ten points for every soldier killed. When you reach certain point milestones you move up a level. Every move up a level adds another weapon to your backpack. If you find the matching weapon in the map then you get a bonus, such as a scope or faster bullets. The goal is still to eliminate all the zombies. Good luck. The city is counting on you to save it!
