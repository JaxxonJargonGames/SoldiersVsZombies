# Jaxxon Jargon's Soldiers Vs. Zombies
 
Experience a new Zombie Apocalypse. Using a variety of weapons, eliminate all the zombies to win. Beware! This game is simple, but harder than it looks.

Here is the point system: one point for every zombie killed, one point for every window shattered, and minus ten points for every soldier killed. When you reach certain point milestones you move up a level. Every move up a level adds another weapon to your backpack. If you find the matching weapon in the map then you get a bonus, such as a scope or faster bullets. The goal is still to eliminate all the zombies. Good luck. The city is counting on you to save it!

One key to eliminating all the zombies is to understand where they come from. When the game begins there are four red, zombie-spawning diamonds located in each of the four office buildings. And while not a lot is known or understood about these diamonds, we do know that they spawn zombies and that they can be converted to a portal that allows our military to send soldiers through the diamonds. When you touch or pass through one of these diamonds they change from red to green and allow friendly soldiers to enter the game space and help shoot the zombies. So you definitely want to convert all the zombie diamonds while avoiding getting attacked by the zombies.

Another key is knowing about your weapons and how to use them. When you first enter the game your backpack contains a pistol, crossbow, and sniper rifle. The crossbow is pretty handy at shooting zombies. The sniper rifle is the only one of the three that can shoot through the glass windows. You score points when you shoot a window (1 point) or a zombie (1 point). If you accidentally shoot a soldier you lose 10 points.

As you gain points you move up a level at certain milestones. With each new level you receive a new weapon in your backpack: 20 points earns Level 2 and gets you a grenade launcher, 40 points earns Level 3 and gets you an automatic rifle, 80 points earns Level 4 and gets you a rocket launcher, and 160 points earns Level 5 and gets you a railgun. The grenade launcher, rocket launcher and railgun are all capable of shattering multiple windows which allows you to score points.
